    abstract="Correcting a similarity index for chance agreement requires computing its expectation under fixed marginal totals of a matching counts matrix. For some indices, such as Jaccard, Rogers and Tanimoto, Sokal and Sneath, and Gower and Legendre the expectations cannot be easily found. We show how such similarity indices can be expressed as functions of other indices and expectations found by approximations such that approximate correction is possible. A second approach is based on Taylor series expansion. A simulation study illustrates the effectiveness of the resulting correction of similarity indices using structured and unstructured data generated from bivariate normal distributions.",

abstract="Mutual information is a common feature score in feature selection for text categorization. Mutual information suffers from two theoretical problems: It assumes independent word variables, and longer documents are given higher weights in the estimation of the feature scores, which is in contrast to common evaluation measures that do not distinguish between long and short documents. We propose a variant of mutual information, called Weighted Average Pointwise Mutual Information (WAPMI) that avoids both problems. We provide theoretical as well as extensive empirical evidence in favor of WAPMI. Furthermore, we show that WAPMI has a nice property that other feature metrics lack, namely it allows to select the best feature set size automatically by maximizing an objective function, which can be done using a simple heuristic without resorting to costly methods like EM and model selection.",

abstract="In many applications of natural language processing (NLP) it is necessary to determine the likelihood of a given word combination. For example, a speech recognizer may need to determine which of the two word combinations ``eat a peach'' and ''eat a beach'' is more likely. Statistical NLP methods determine the likelihood of a word combination from its frequency in a training corpus. However, the nature of language is such that many word combinations are infrequent and do not occur in any given corpus. In this work we propose a method for estimating the probability of such previously unseen word combinations using available information on ``most similar'' words.",
