    abstract="Correcting a similarity index for chance agreement requires computing its expectation under fixed marginal totals of a matching counts matrix. For some indices, such as Jaccard, Rogers and Tanimoto, Sokal and Sneath, and Gower and Legendre the expectations cannot be easily found. We show how such similarity indices can be expressed as functions of other indices and expectations found by approximations such that approximate correction is possible. A second approach is based on Taylor series expansion. A simulation study illustrates the effectiveness of the resulting correction of similarity indices using structured and unstructured data generated from bivariate normal distributions.",

abstract="Mutual information is a common feature score in feature selection for text categorization. Mutual information suffers from two theoretical problems: It assumes independent word variables, and longer documents are given higher weights in the estimation of the feature scores, which is in contrast to common evaluation measures that do not distinguish between long and short documents. We propose a variant of mutual information, called Weighted Average Pointwise Mutual Information (WAPMI) that avoids both problems. We provide theoretical as well as extensive empirical evidence in favor of WAPMI. Furthermore, we show that WAPMI has a nice property that other feature metrics lack, namely it allows to select the best feature set size automatically by maximizing an objective function, which can be done using a simple heuristic without resorting to costly methods like EM and model selection.",

abstract="In many applications of natural language processing (NLP) it is necessary to determine the likelihood of a given word combination. For example, a speech recognizer may need to determine which of the two word combinations ``eat a peach'' and ''eat a beach'' is more likely. Statistical NLP methods determine the likelihood of a word combination from its frequency in a training corpus. However, the nature of language is such that many word combinations are infrequent and do not occur in any given corpus. In this work we propose a method for estimating the probability of such previously unseen word combinations using available information on ``most similar'' words.",

  abstract =      {In statistical relational learning, the link prediction problem is key to automatically understand the structure of large knowledge bases. As in previous studies, we propose to solve this problem through latent factorization. However, here we make use of complex valued embeddings. The composition of complex embeddings can handle a large variety of binary relations, among them symmetric and antisymmetric relations. Compared to state-of-the-art models such as Neural Tensor Network and Holographic Embeddings, our approach based on complex embeddings is arguably simpler, as it only uses the Hermitian dot product, the complex counterpart of the standard dot product between real vectors. Our approach is scalable to large datasets as it remains linear in both space and time, while consistently outperforming alternative approaches on standard link prediction benchmarks.}

abstract = {AMiner is the second generation of the ArnetMiner system. We focus on developing author-centric analytic and mining tools for gaining a deep understanding of the large and heterogeneous networks formed by authors, papers, venues, and knowledge concepts. One fundamental goal is how to extract and integrate semantics from different sources. We have developed algorithms to automatically extract researchers' profiles from the Web and re- solve the name ambiguity problem, and connect different professional networks. We also developed methodologies to incorporate knowledge from the Wikipedia and other sources into the system to bridge the gap between network science and the web mining research. In this talk, I will focus on answering two fundamental questions for author-centric network analysis: who is who? and who are similar to each other? The system has been in operation since 2006 and has collected more than 100,000,000 author profiles, 100,000,000 publication papers, and 7,800,000 knowledge concepts. It has been widely used for collaboration recommendation, similarity analysis, and community evolution.},

abstract = {Prediction tasks over nodes and edges in networks require careful effort in engineering features used by learning algorithms. Recent research in the broader field of representation learning has led to significant progress in automating prediction by learning the features themselves. However, present feature learning approaches are not expressive enough to capture the diversity of connectivity patterns observed in networks. Here we propose node2vec, an algorithmic framework for learning continuous feature representations for nodes in networks. In node2vec, we learn a mapping of nodes to a low-dimensional space of features that maximizes the likelihood of preserving network neighborhoods of nodes. We define a flexible notion of a node's network neighborhood and design a biased random walk procedure, which efficiently explores diverse neighborhoods. Our algorithm generalizes prior work which is based on rigid notions of network neighborhoods, and we argue that the added flexibility in exploring neighborhoods is the key to learning richer representations.We demonstrate the efficacy of node2vec over existing state-of-the-art techniques on multi-label classification and link prediction in several real-world networks from diverse domains. Taken together, our work represents a new way for efficiently learning state-of-the-art task-independent representations in complex networks.},
